# Product Context: xdash

*   **Problem Solved**: Addresses the need for a simple, efficient alternative to larger JavaScript utility libraries, specifically designed for TypeScript environments with a focus on strong typing, performance, and tree-shakability.
*   **Target Users**: TypeScript developers looking for a lightweight, modern, and performant utility toolkit that integrates well with modern build processes.
*   **User Experience Goals**: 
    *   Easy installation via common package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm, bun).
    *   Clear and accessible documentation (generated via TypeDoc, potentially hosted on xdash.vercel.app).
    *   Flexibility through modular imports (import only what's needed).
    *   Enhanced code safety and developer experience through strong typing and type guards.
