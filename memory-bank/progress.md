# Progress: xdash

*   **What Works/Understood**:
    *   Project identity, core purpose, high-level structure.
    *   Technology stack: TypeScript, Bun, VitePress, TypeDoc (for API MD generation), Jest (via `bun test`).
    *   Build, test scripts updated.
    *   Basic VitePress site structure created with Hero Page and sidebar linking to generated API files.
    *   Most tests refactored and passing.
    *   `README.md` updated with stronger selling points and support link.
    *   `.gitignore` updated to exclude generated API docs (`docs/api/`).
    *   GitHub repository settings (description, topics, URL) updated.
    *   GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) created for testing, building, npm publish, and docs deployment.
    *   Git tag `v0.5.12` created and pushed to trigger npm publish.
    *   Standard `LICENSE` (MIT) and `CHANGELOG.md` files added.
*   **What's Left/Planned**:
    1.  **Push & Verify**: Push latest commits (LICENSE, CHANGELOG) to GitHub. Monitor CI/CD workflow runs. Verify npm publish (v0.5.12) and GitHub Pages deployment.
    2.  **Fix `semanticSlice`**: Debug and fix the function and its tests. (Semantic module removed)
    3.  **Benchmarking**: Add performance benchmarks.
    4.  **Enhance Docs**: Manually add detailed examples and tutorials to generated API Markdown files.
    5.  **Review JSDoc**: Address TypeDoc warnings about unused `@param` tags.
    6.  **Create `CONTRIBUTING.md`**.
*   **Current Status**: First release (`v0.5.12`) triggered. Standard project files (LICENSE, CHANGELOG) added. Ready to push latest commits and verify CI/CD outcomes.
*   **Known Issues**: TypeDoc shows warnings about unused `@param` tags. (Semantic module removed)
