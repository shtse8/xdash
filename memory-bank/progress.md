    *   Core purpose and features: Modularity, performance, typing, tree-shakability.
    *   Technology stack: TypeScript, Bun, Astro, TypeDoc.
    *   Build, test, and release processes (defined in `package.json` scripts).
    *   High-level file/directory structure and the role of each major part (`src`, `tests`, `dist`, `docs`, `astro`).
    *   Package publication details (npm package, export map).
*   **What's Left/Unknown**: 
    *   Detailed implementation logic of individual utility functions in `src/`.
    *   Specific testing strategies and coverage in `tests/`.
    *   Exact content and structure of the Astro documentation site in `astro/`.
    *   Details of the contribution guidelines.
    *   Specific coding style or linting rules (no config files like `.eslintrc` or `.prettierrc` seen at root level yet).
*   **Current Status**: Initial project analysis completed. Memory Bank files created and populated with baseline information.
*   **Known Issues**: None identified during initial analysis.
