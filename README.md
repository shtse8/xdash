## Why Choose xdash? üî•

`xdash` isn't just another utility library. It's a philosophy focused on **developer efficiency and application performance**:

- **Laser-Focused Modularity**: üì¶ Import *only* the functions you need. Keep your application lean and fast.
- **Aggressive Tree-Shaking**: üå≥ Seamless integration with modern build tools like Vite, esbuild, and Webpack ensures minimal bundle size. No dead code, guaranteed.
- **Blazing Performance**: ‚ö° Every function is optimized for speed. We benchmark rigorously so you don't have to worry about bottlenecks.
- **Rock-Solid Typing**: üîí Leverage the full power of TypeScript. Our strong types and type guards catch errors at compile time, not runtime, saving you precious debugging hours.
- **Zero Runtime Dependencies**: üö´ Absolutely no baggage. `xdash` adds only the code you use.
- **Modern Tooling**: ‚ú® Built with Bun, tested with Jest, documented with VitePress & TypeDoc. We embrace the best of the modern web ecosystem.

## Core Features üõ†Ô∏è

- **Essential Utilities**: A curated collection covering arrays, objects, strings, async operations, type checking, and more.
- **Functional Programming Inspired**: Clean, predictable, and composable functions.
- **Chainable Interface**: An optional, expressive way to link operations (`x.chain(...)`).
- **Inline Switch**: A powerful alternative to traditional switch statements (`x.InlineSwitch(...)`).
- **Comprehensive Testing**: High test coverage ensures reliability and stability.
- **Crystal-Clear Documentation**: Easily searchable and navigable docs generated via VitePress.

## Installation üíæ

Integrate `xdash` into your project in seconds:

```bash
npm install xdash
# or
yarn add xdash
# or
pnpm add xdash
# or
bun install xdash
```

## Quick Start Example ‚ö°

```typescript
import { isStr, capitalize } from 'xdash';
// Or import the whole library
// import * as x from 'xdash';

let greeting = "hello, world!";

if (isStr(greeting)) {
  // capitalize is type-safe thanks to isStr!
  console.log(capitalize(greeting)); // Outputs: "Hello, world!"
}

// Chain example
const result = x.chain([1, 2, 3])
  .map(n => n * 2)
  .filter(n => n > 3)
  .sum() // Assuming sum is added or available
  .value(); // result = 10 (4 + 6)

console.log(result);
```
